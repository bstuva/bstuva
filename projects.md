## Project Description

### Overview

I partnered with Link Clicks Inc. to design, develop, and deploy a cutting-edge Software as a Service (SaaS) platform, specifically tailored for the 3D printing industry. This platform aims to offer comprehensive services such as website hosting, inventory management, quoting, order tracking, and payment processing. Our goal was to create a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that delivers significant value to 3D printing businesses, streamlining their operations and enhancing their online presence.

#### Technical Stack

- **Front-end:** React, Bootstrap
- **Back-end:** Node.js
- **Design:** Figma for wireframes and design mock-ups
- **Database:** MySQL
- **Real-time Communication:** Socket.IO
- **Deployment:** AWS EC2
- **Version Control:** GitHub

#### Motivation

The 3D printing sector is rapidly growing, yet small enterprises face challenges such as customer outreach, order management, and operational efficiency. Our platform addresses these issues, offering a tailored solution to improve business processes, save time, and enhance their digital footprint.

### Deliverables

- **Design Mock-ups:** Created using Figma to showcase the application's user flow and design.
- **Database Schema:** Implemented with Sequelize to accurately represent data relationships and requirements.
- **Front-End and Back-End Code:** Comprehensive, documented codebases for the platform's interface and server-side logic.
- **API Integration:** Detailed documentation on integrating third-party APIs for payments, account management, and analytics.
- **Demo Video:** A video presentation demonstrating the application's functionality and impact.

### Learning Experience

Participants gained hands-on experience in a real-world project setting, enhancing skills in front-end and back-end development, database management, API integration, and more. This project not only bolstered technical abilities but also provided valuable insights into project management, collaboration, and problem-solving within a software development lifecycle.

### Contribution to the 3D Printing Industry

By automating and streamlining operations for small 3D printing businesses, our platform represents a significant advancement in how these companies manage their workflows, engage with customers, and expand their market presence.

### Final Thoughts

This capstone project embodies a collaborative effort to deliver a practical, impactful solution to the 3D printing industry. It showcases our ability to innovate, adapt, and execute complex software development projects, preparing us for future challenges and opportunities in the tech sector.
